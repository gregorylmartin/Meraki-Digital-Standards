Coding Standards for Meraki Digital Developers

- [PHP  Standards](https://github.com/gregorylmartin/Meraki-Standards/tree/master/php)
- [JS   Standards](https://github.com/gregorylmartin/Meraki-Standards/tree/master/js)
- [HTML Standards](https://github.com/gregorylmartin/Meraki-Standards/tree/master/html)
- [CSS  Standards](https://github.com/gregorylmartin/Meraki-Standards/tree/master/css)


These standards are HEAVILY borrowed from the excellent standards use by the good folks at [WordPress.org](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/).  This is intended for our internal use among our own developers, but see no harm in re-sharing it here.  This is a living set of standards.  We will continually update and augment as appropriate or as even better practices emerge to take the place of current "best practices".
